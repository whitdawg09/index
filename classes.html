    My favorite classes are:
<ul>
    <li> Study Hall - I love study hall becuase it is a good amount of time to get all my work done and I like being with my friends.</li>
   <li> WEB - I have gotten really interested in programming and I like WEB because it helps me further my skills.</li> 
   <li>EP8 - EP is fun becuase we have learned so much about climate change and the enviornment and I can use that knowledge to help make a difference.</li>
   <li>Math - Mr. Graybeal is our math teacher and he is funny and makes class interesting.</li>
</ul>
